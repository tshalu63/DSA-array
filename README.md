📦 DSA – Arrays (Java)
📘 What is an Array?

An array is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.
Each element is accessed using an index (0-based in Java).

✅ Key Points

Fixed size

Fast access using index → O(1)

Stores homogeneous data

Memory efficient

Used as a base for many DSA concepts

🔹 Types of Arrays in Java

1D Array – Linear list

2D Array – Matrix / table

Multidimensional Array – Array of arrays

🔹 Array Operations (Very Important)
Operation	Time Complexity
Access	O(1)
Traversal	O(n)
Insertion	O(n)
Deletion	O(n)
Searching (Linear)	O(n)
Searching (Binary – sorted)	O(log n)
🔹 Why Arrays are Important in DSA?

Used in sorting algorithms

Used in searching algorithms

Foundation for stack, queue, hash table

Common in interview problems
